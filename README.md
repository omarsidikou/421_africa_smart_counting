The aim of this application is to have a dashboard with a daily average count of  people on different part of the cities of Nairobi 
based on smartphone wifi-signal even if there not connected to an access point.

The problem we are trying to solve behind that how local authoraties can have a better visibilty on people mobilty during the day
so that they will be able to better react on "near realtime" on challenge like traffic congestion, air pollution.

Based on that application it will be easier to design an accurate urban devlopment plan for the city.
